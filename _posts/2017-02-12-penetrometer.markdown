Designed, developed, and tested data acquistion system for the use of archaeologists at the National Park Service. Final data acquisition system could be controlled by any WiFi enabled device (i.e. smartphone, laptop) and recorded data from two force sensors and a laser range finder. As part of project, besides writing the webapp itself, I also designed the interface circuits between the sensors and the BeagleBone Black being used as the "brains" of the operation. I also did the design of the mechanism that the sensors attached to.

Once everything was designed and built, I designed and ran experiments to verify the design, and analyzed the results.
