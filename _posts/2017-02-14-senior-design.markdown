On team that built a small robot as part of the IEEE SouthEastCon Hardware Competition. Team came in 7th out of 39 schools. I was the only mechanical engineer on a team of Electrical and Computer Engineers. I was in charge of the chassis design and finalized the design of the actuators. I also did some programming of the actuators.
