TRT-Z (Tiny Robot Tank - Zumo) is a small scale skid-steered robot built
off of the Pololu Zumo chassis. The platform is designed to be easier
to run experiments on compared to the large platforms used
currently at Florida State.

To allow for modeling, the final design of the robot will record the
current being used from the motors as well as the acceleration of
the robot via an IMU.

The whole system runs off an MSP432 microcontroller using TI-RTOS.
